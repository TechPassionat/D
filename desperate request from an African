Positive wishes to everyone reading this message in 2023.

my name is KOUNCHOU BORIS, i am an African. I would like to thank every world leader for the effort they have put in place last year to help weak
countries survive regardless of the influence of most powerfull ones. Your prompt reaction to those countries' difficulties made me believe that there
is still hope and probably you are not aware of what happened in Africa, otherwise you would have helped us as well.

Africa is a great country on my opinion that faced severed law violations from some countries, it is more than 50 years now and nothing has been
done yet to make Africans think they are also valuable in this world. Last year, i even thought sometimes that maybe the world is only
helping WHITE PEOPLE. BUT I KNOW IT IS NOT THE CASE.

Please i beg EVERY SINGLE WORLD LEADER to do something for Africans, and make JUSTICE available to everybody in this world in the equal manner. 


desperate request from an African hopping for justice.
